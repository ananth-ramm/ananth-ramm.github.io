    <h2>What is a Margin?</h2>
    <div>

    </div>
    <p>Think of an HTML like a box. So you would have your content (words or an image e.g) in your website, you could add a padding around it which would create space between your content and border.
       You can add a border if you want your content to <span class="highlight">stick out</span> giving it a frame. Now this is where we get to the margin, the margin is the space between your framed 
       or non-framed content and the walls of the website. Margins allow you to make you website look nice and neat creating even spacing between your content so it doesn't look too compact and messy.

    <div class="spaced">This paragraph is using margins from an external stylesheet!</div>
    <img src="../pictures/Screenshot Margin.png" alt="Screenshot of the code I used to create this margin">
    <div></div>
    <p>Above is the code I used to create an element using margins. I decided to create a class called 'spaced' I applied this class to the element above in my html file and picked dimensions in pixels 
       in my CSS file to arrange the element and I positioned it where I was satisfied using the margin command.    </p>
