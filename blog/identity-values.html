    <h2>Describe an ethical decision you've made</h2>
    <br>
    <p>An ethical decision I've made recently was finding somebody's company card and find ways to return it to the owner as I was in a rush.
       I found this card outside a Pizza Hut, it was for some sort of nurse if I recall and there was no contact information, and I don't I 
       was able to find the location of occupation either. So with no leads for contact, theres was at least an I.D so hoping that he bought some 
       pizza, I asked if that person had purchased something recently and they did! So Pizza Hut took it in and contacted them. I weighed out the 
       decision by trying to take care of it quickly or let it fall into the wrongs and let that person worry about it so I feel good I did it so 
       the situation didn't escalate.

    <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am a Fijian-Indian and growing up in a Hindu household, my values and identity have been deeply shaped by both my religion and my family. 
       Growing up in a Hindu family as well as quite a big family everything was always festive and lively, being the youngest I had a lot of relatives
       to look up to so I guess my values were based around that.</p>

    <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I did VIA character test and my top 10 strengths in chronological order is</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Creativity</li>
    <li>Fairness</li>
    <li>Perspective</li>
    <li>Social Intelligence</li>    
    <li>Honesty</li>
    <li>Kindness</li>
    <li>Humour</li>
    <li>Spirituality</li>
    <li>Love of Learning</li>
    <li>Gratitude</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I believe my creativity and love of learning will help me think outside the box when required along with the love of learning to keep
    me engaged and get through my task.
    </p>

    <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Limitations of mine is getting distracted easily and procastinating, a dangerous combination to say the least. 
       These affect my learning journey by slowing me down and feeling stuck in a loop as you try start the task but your
       consciously or subconsciously wanders and you have to rely on yourself to ground yourself back maintain focus and
       end being less motivated as you spend time on energy-draining activities. Recently I have been good with countering this 
       by catching myself zoneout within 10 seconds I try ground myself and become more aware of it and when it happens so I can 
       prevent it from going on longer and I try warm up before my tasks with some writing as I jump straight into reading it's 
       easy for me to get distracted.

    <h5>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
        Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h5>
    <br>
    <p>I would say in school for a group project each individual was trying to lead the group in the direction they wanted it to go
       but it would lead to more disengagement and interaction between the group, so my friend and I suggested instead of trying to/make things
       look a certain way, we could just share ideas and key concepts between the group to first finalise our content and then brainstorm ideas 
       for a final product and eventually came into an agreement for how the final prodcut should be and look and we received a good grade in the end.
       In the future I would stick to the same method, brainstorming with the group and sharing and branching off different ideas and then bringing it 
       all together to create a satisfactory final product.
