<h1>Learning Plan</h1>
<br>
<div class="main-content">
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My long term goal is to work my way towards somewhat finanicial freedom and at an occupation I can see myself in and enjoy and I feel I can do that here at
       Dev Academy in a balanced and enjoyable study program too.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I believe some of my strengths are enjoying problem-solving and especially development proccess such as building a website. I find it quite interesting and 
       within my ability with helps keep my going and once I start i'm on a role. My main limitation is getting distracted easily but I have been working on it and 
       have made decent improvement but it'll be a work in progress throughout this course. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>While at Dev Academy, i'd like to take the opportunity to improve on my time-management, communication and engagement. I'd like to be more strict on myself for time-manegement
       making sure I submit my assignments and challenges on time, keeping on top of my studies. I'd also like to put myself out there more and engage with my fellow peers and homegroup
       as well as being able to communicate my issues, espescially if I get stuck or get delayed or need help, I need to rememeber to communicate.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I will manaage my workload by sticking to the timeboxes and using pomodoro timer and when things are starting to get to me I will speak up and ask for help in a timely manner
        whether its from a facilitator, fellow peers, family or the discord channel. I'll work on reaching out for help when I need it instead of staying stuck on a problem for a while.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h5>
    <br>
    <p>I can expect to rely on the Facilitation team for help and thats fulfilled with our weekly homegroup sessions where we have the opportunity to ask questions and extra guidance if needed
       which could be done through email or discord.
    </p>

    <h6>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>I don't have any conflicting commitments at the moment as I'm trying put my time and focus the sprints and do my best.</p>
