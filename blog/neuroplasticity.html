<h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
<br>
<div class="main-content">
    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains. Understanding and being aware of principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
       by helping people stay motivated during tasks or even boost morale and/or performance, becomes more clear that repitition is a powerful method to utilise. Believing in yourself, believing 
       that the brains capacity and abilities are not fixed but endless can work wonders. Some ways you could engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for you benefit is practicing through repitition,
       consistent practice will strengthen the brain's neural pathways. Reflecting is another good principle to engage with as this will have you actively thinking about what you learned/practiced 
       and help reinforce and retain it better. Adding some resistance, challenge, or something unfamiliar is another good principle which will help you build new connections in the brain. Ways I 
       plan to increase my neuroplasticity would be regular activity through resistance training and aerobic exercises. For me exercise is good because when my body is active my brain is not so much active
       which is good because of 'Wu Ji Bi Fan (物极必反)' a quote I learned from Jackie Chan in Karate Kid meaning 'when things reach an extreme, they reverse direction'. What I'm trying to say is too muh brain
       isn't good, especially if you're an overthinker or surely even a brain with no thoughts needs a break, regardless it's good to allow your brain to have a guided break so you don't burnout and crave too much
       dopamine through some kind of distraction such as your phone. I plan to also practice mindfulness everyday and priortise a healthy and consistent sleeping pattern to aid my neural/cognitive performance. 
       I will also challenge myself by learning new things and most importantly I will practice by repeating and reflecting on the things I've learned.

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <br>
    <p>A Growth Mindset, a term introduced by Dr. Carol Dweck, beleives that you can enhance your intelligence, abilities and talents through hard work, learning and persistance. 
       A growth mindset is releveant because they are very similar as they both build resilience, taking feedback constructively and embracing challenges. 
       What surprised me what just how much you can alter the brain's capability and capacity, learning about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset showed me that the brain is always capable of change, even as an adult.
       Understanding that every time I practice a skill or push through a challenge, I’m literally rewiring my brain, that changed how I see mistakes. They’re not signs of failure, but steps forward. 
       I will change how I talk to myself when things get difficult. Instead of saying “I’m not good at this,” I’ll remind myself, “I just haven’t mastered it yet.” I’ll treat mistakes and challenges as part of the learning process, not something to be ashamed of.
       I’ll also focus more on effort and consistency, not just results. If something doesn’t come easily, I won’t give up, I’ll break it into smaller steps and keep practicing. I’ll ask for help when I need it and use feedback as a tool to grow, not as criticism.
       By keeping a growth mindset, I’ll stay more motivated, open to learning, and confident that I can improve, no matter where I start. <a class="site" target="blank" href="https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/">This website</a> proved to be quite useful and interesting for me!

    <h4>Reflect</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset has reshaped my approach to facing challenges and to tackle them knowing they’re helping me grow and understand. I’ll try to use the AGES model to plan my study time by creating my own notes, 
       experiement with connecting learning to emotions or real-life examples, and spacing out my study sessions. I’ll also remind myself during tough moments that my skills can improve with practice.
