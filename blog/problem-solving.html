<h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h2>A time I was stuck on a problem</h2>
    <br>
    <p>A time I was stuck on a problem was when I was using .split(' ') and .join(' ') for the first time I was getting frustrated because I was sure my code was right but I didn't 
        have a space in between my apostrophe and it kept failing. I kept trying and console logged the result to see what was going on. I was researching what was could be wrong
        with my code until eventually I thouroughly read mycode using the rubber ducky method I was able to spot it. I made the change and my test passed, I was very happy to see the green tick.
        With such small mistakes I learned how sensitive JavaScript can be and that it's good to read over your code a few times to help you narrow down accuracy.

    <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>    
    <br>
    <p>A time I elegantly solved a problem was when I had to complete a getAverage function that takes a name parameter and returns the average of the students test scores. 
       Some of the previous exercises had similar problems so when it came to this one I got a good understanding  of the question and headed in the rigth track to write my code. 
       I felt good as I was getting into the groove of things for that section and a lot of things were clicking.

    <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h4>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Pseudocode - I feel confident using Pseudocode, it helps get me actively thinking about the problem to plan it out and helps me feel confident when I am writing my code out.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Trying Something - I feel confident trying something, it gets me to think outside the box more and explore, research and experiment with different solutions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rubber Ducky Method - I feel confident using the rubber ducky method as it helps me focus on what I'm saying/reading so I spot my mistakes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reading Error Messages - I feel confident using reading error messages, I find it concise and straightforwrd knowing whats causing the error.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Console Logging - I feel confident using console log, I enjoyed using console log for the test as it was easy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Googling - I feel confident using Google, I try use this as a last resort especialy if I'm absolutely stuck otherwise I'll try work out the porblem to the best of my ability or at least using other methods to help me troubleshoot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Asking peers for help - I feel confident asking peers for help, I've only asked once but I'm confident that I can rely on them for help if needed and expect that they can point my in the right direction for a solution.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Asking coaches for help - Probably not as confident yet but a a work in progress</li>
        <br>
        <li>Improving my process with reflection - I feel confident with relfection as I've reflected on everything I've leaerned and definitely helps it sink in more and retain information better so I know what to do if I come accross a similar problem.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h4>
    <p>I was pretty much reluctant to ask for help entirely as I was already behind and didn't want to show I was stuck in case if teachers thought I wouldn't catch up on time. But I will do better in reaching out when I need help.
